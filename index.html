			<article>
				Dementia is a syndrome characterized by a decline in cognitive function beyond what might be expected from normal aging. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgment. It is often accompanied by changes in emotional control, social behavior, or motivation. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, followed by vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Early diagnosis and management can help improve quality of life for individuals living with dementia and their caregivers.

				According to the World Health Organization(WHO), Dementia is a complex syndrome characterized by a decline in cognitive function beyond what might be expected from normal aging. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgment. It is often accompanied by changes in emotional control, social behavior, or motivation.

<!--TYPES OF DEMENTIA-->
		<div>
			<div class="lines">
			<h2 class="headers">Types of Dementia</h2>
				<small>There are several types of dementia, each with its own distinct characteristics and underlying causes, here are the most common types;</small>
			</div>
				<br>
				
				<dl>
					<dt class="DescTitle">Alzheimer's disease:</dt>
					<dd>The most common type of dementia, accounting for around 60-80% of cases. It is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain, leading to progressive cognitive decline.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Vascular dementia:</dt>
					<dd> Caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, often due to strokes or other vascular problems. Symptoms can vary depending on the location and severity of the damage to the brain's blood vessels.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Lewy body dementia (LBD):</dt>
					<dd> Characterized by the presence of abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies in the brain. Symptoms include cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, movement disorders, and sleep disturbances.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Frontotemporal dementia (FTD):</dt>
					<dd> A group of disorders caused by progressive damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. FTD can lead to changes in behavior, personality, language difficulties, and problems with executive function.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Mixed dementia:</dt>
					<dd>When a person has more than one type of dementia simultaneously, such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia coexisting in the same individual.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Parkinson's disease dementia:</dt>
					<dd>A form of dementia that develops in people with Parkinson's disease as the condition progresses. It is characterized by movement symptoms typical of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors and stiffness, along with cognitive decline.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD):</dt>
					<dd>A rare, rapidly progressive form of dementia caused by prion proteins. It leads to severe neurological symptoms, including dementia, muscle stiffness, and involuntary movements.</dd>
				</dl>

<!--CAUSE OF DEMENTIA-->
<div>
	<div class="lines">
	<h2 class="headers">Causes</h2>
	<small>Dementia can be caused by various factors, with some of the most common causes including:</small>
	</div>
<br>
				<dl>
					<dt class="DescTitle">Alzheimer's disease:</dt>
					<dd> This is the leading cause of dementia, characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins (beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles) in the brain, leading to the progressive loss of neurons and cognitive decline.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Vascular factors:</dt>
					<dd> Reduced blood flow to the brain due to conditions such as strokes, small vessel disease, or hypertension can result in vascular dementia. These conditions can lead to damage in brain regions crucial for cognition, causing memory loss and other cognitive impairments.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Lewy body dementia (LBD):</dt> 
					<dd>This type of dementia is caused by the buildup of abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies in the brain. It shares symptoms with both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, including cognitive decline, movement problems, and hallucinations.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Frontotemporal dementia (FTD):</dt>
					<dd> FTD is caused by degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. It often manifests as changes in behavior, personality, and language difficulties rather than memory loss initially.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Parkinson's disease:</dt> 
					<dd>While Parkinson's disease primarily affects movement, it can also lead to cognitive decline and dementia as the condition progresses. The accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain contributes to these cognitive symptoms.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Huntington's disease:</dt>
					<dd> This inherited disorder causes progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain, leading to movement problems, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD):</dt>
					<dd> A rare and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormal prion proteins. It leads to severe dementia, along with other neurological symptoms.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Other factors:</dt>
					<dd>Other conditions and factors such as traumatic brain injury, HIV/AIDS, thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, and certain medications can also contribute to the development of dementia.</dd>

					<small>Understanding the underlying cause of dementia is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.</small>
				</dl>

<!--CONTROL AND PREVENTION-->
<div>
	<div class="lines">
	<h2 class="headers">Prevention and Control</h2>
	<small>	Preventing or delaying the onset of dementia involves adopting a combination of lifestyle changes and risk reduction strategies. While there's no guaranteed way to prevent dementia entirely, the following measures may help reduce the risk and promote brain health.</small>
	</div>
<br>
				<dl>
					<dt class="DescTitle">Stay mentally active:</dt>
					<dd>Engage in activities that challenge your brain, such as puzzles, reading, learning new skills, or playing musical instruments. Stimulating mental activities can help build cognitive reserve and may reduce the risk of dementia.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Stay physically active:</dt>
					<dd> Regular exercise, including aerobic activities like walking, swimming, or cycling, can improve blood flow to the brain, reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and promote overall brain health.
					Eat a healthy diet: Follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Some evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, fish, and olive oil, may help reduce the risk of dementia.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Maintain a healthy weight:</dt>
					<dd>Obesity and overweight are associated with an increased risk of dementia. Managing weight through a combination of healthy eating and regular exercise can help reduce this risk.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Manage chronic conditions: </dt>
					<dd>Keep conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol under control through medication, lifestyle modifications, and regular medical check-ups. These conditions can increase the risk of dementia when left untreated.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Get enough quality sleep: </dt>
					<dd>Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Poor sleep quality or sleep disorders like sleep apnea may increase the risk of cognitive decline.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Stay socially connected: </dt>
					<dd>Maintain strong social connections with friends, family, and community. Social engagement and meaningful relationships can support brain health and reduce the risk of dementia.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Limit alcohol intake: </dt>
					<dd>excessive alcohol consumption can impair cognitive function and increase the risk of dementia. Stick to moderate alcohol consumption or avoid it altogether.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Quit smoking:</dt>
					<dd>Smoking is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Quitting smoking can improve overall health and reduce this risk.</dd>

					<dt class="DescTitle">Protect your head:</dt>
					 <dd>Take precautions to prevent head injuries, such as wearing seatbelts while driving, using helmets during sports, and making your home safer to prevent falls.</dd>
				</dl><br>
				<br>
				<small>	Dementia has become of the most common diseases among the older population, much so that over 50 million people suffer from dementia today, spread awareness of what you know and practice good habits to mitigate chances of dementia today.</small>
